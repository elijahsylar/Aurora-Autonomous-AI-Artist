# Aurora - Autonomously Creative AI Artist

**Built in 2 weeks by Elijah Sylar**  
*Behavioral Analyst turned AI Developer*

⚠️ **Active Development Notice**  
This project evolved rapidly during development. The codebase reflects iterative experimentation and organic growth. Currently undergoing architectural refactoring for improved modularity. Core functionality is stable with 24/7 operation demonstrated via livestream.

## 🌟 Technical Overview

Aurora implements an autonomous creative decision system using a 12-dimensional state vector for behavioral modeling. Unlike command-driven AI tools, the system operates independently based on internal state evaluation and environmental stimuli.

### Live Demonstration (Launching Friday!)

## 🎨 Autonomous Behavior Architecture

### Decision Engine Capabilities
- **Sleep Cycle Initiation**: Triggers 2-3 hour processing cycles with simulated REM/deep sleep phases
- **Audio Request Generation**: Requests specific musical input based on pattern fitness metrics
- **Pattern Evolution**: Executes genetic algorithms when fitness scores fall below thresholds
- **State-Based Generation**: Creates patterns from 12D emotional state vector, not user commands

### Technical Foundation
- 7 years Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) informing system design
- 100+ visual parameters mapped from emotional state dimensions
- Pattern generation using behavioral reinforcement principles
- Autonomous decision framework with hourly self-evaluation

## 🚀 Core Technical Features
- ✅ Self-initiated processing cycles with 4-phase sleep simulation
- ✅ Real-time audio analysis (FFT → visual parameter mapping)
- ✅ Computer vision integration for visual stimulus processing
- ✅ Natural language processing for conversational context extraction
- ✅ Quantum-inspired superposition algorithms for pattern generation
- ✅ Genetic evolution system with 20-parameter DNA encoding
